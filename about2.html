    <h1>What is PostSecretU?</h1>

    <p><h4>PostSecretU is the university-specific version of Frank Warren’s site that is run through a partnership with Active Minds, Inc. This program provides a forum for college students to express thoughts and experiences that they would otherwise hide. Students are invited to submit postcards where they write a secret – a characteristic about themselves that they would not otherwise share. These postcards are collected and then displayed through a public art installation. These postcards from members of the AU community are meant to foster an environment where students do not feel alone. Ideally after viewing the installation, students will view certain secrets and think “Hey, me too!”, causing them to feel less alone in their secrets. This encourages an environment where stigma and shame is alleviated, allowing students to be more open about their true thoughts and feelings. PostSecretU aims to allow students to discover that they are not alone in their secrets – and that common issues and themes, particularly related to mental health, are common on college campuses. The project is meant to start the conversation on mental health on conversation by approaching the topic through the lens of something that is familiar – sharing a secret.</p>
    <p>PostSecretU differs from PostSecret because it does not have an online component. Instead, the Secrets are displayed as a public art project. The secrets are meant to spark continuing conversations about the topics and connect students to mental health resources. Additionally, PostSecretU aims to encourage student groups to provide supplemental programming and continue mental health advocacy efforts on college campuses nationwide.</h4></p>
