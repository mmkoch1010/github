    <h1>About The Project</h1>
    <h2>What is PostSecret?</h2>
        <h4>PostSecret is a community art project where people anonymously mail secrets on one side of a postcard. The project was started by Frank Warren in 2005, and encourages strangers to share secrets that are true and have never been shared with anyone. Warren encourages participants to mail the postcards to his home in Germantown, MD. By nature, secrets involve topics that are uncomfortable, and touch upon subjects that are challenging and in some cases taboo. Submissions touch on a variety of topics, including family dynamics, physical/emotional/sexual abuse, mental health, suicide and other various eccentricities.
            <br>Every Sunday, Warren selects roughly 20 postcards to display on his blog, www.postsecret.com. In the ten years since the site launched, Warren has received over 500,000 postcards, and the site has received over 734 million hits, becoming the largest advertisement-free blog in the world. Warren has complied some secrets into six books, and there currently is an exhibit of the postcards he has been sent at the National Postage Museum.
            <br>There is a University version fo this program called PostSecretU that is run through Active Minds, Inc.</h4>
